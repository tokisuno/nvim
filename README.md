# tokisuno's Neovim Setup

## Organization
* I wanted to keep everything isolated from the main nvim folder, so I put everything in a separate folder in the `nvim/lua` dir.
* `lucas` is my (current) main configuration
* This means if you want to test the config on your own, it can be done painlessly!!
